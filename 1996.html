<h1>1996 - 9th Annual Maxwell House Blues Mug Night</h1>
<body>
    <p>
        1996 was a significant departure from previous mug designs. The design was a much thicker mug that actually
        holds a decievingly small amount of liquid. A blue background reminescent of the '89 mug wraps the body, and
        a silouette Kiel Center graphic highlights the center. Unlike any mugs before, this one
        details who the opponent was - the Winnipeg Jets. The trend of Coffee Mug Night games in April was continued
        this year - the Blues 80th game of the season.
