        The 3rd Annual Maxwell House blues Mug differentiated its design from its predecessor in color, size, and "shadow logos" structured in a tile formation around the circumfrence We see the familiar early 90s Blues logo on the front facing side, along with the Maxwell House Coffee Mug logo on the back. The game date designation is stretched in marquee fashion across the bottom section of the mug in similar fashion to the 88-89 mug. By looking closely, small faint Blues and Maxwell House logos appear across the entire face of the mug. A very unique design. This mug was sizably smaller than any before it.
