<h1>1998 - 11th Annual Maxwell House Blues Mug Night</h1>
<body>
    <p>
        The season marks the turn of the century as well as the transition from the 90s style to the early 2000s.
        The 11th Annual Maxwell House Mug was Navy in color with a gold rim, a triangle graphic, and a faceoff dot.
        This is the first mug to designate the mug # with the annual distinction. "The 11th Annual Coffee Mug Night".
        It is also the first to not designate the actual game date on which the mugs were given away.
