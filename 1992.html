        This mug celebrated the Blues 25th season. The marketing team designed a 25th Anniversary logo and color scheme that was produced on an enormous amount of memorabilla. The Maxwell House Coffee Mug Night was no exception. The Maxwell House logo remained a staple, which the Bluenote was replaced with the 25th Anniversary logo.
