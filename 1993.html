<h1>1993 - 6th Annual Maxwell House Blues Mug Night</h1>

    <p>
        The Mug for this season was slighly smaller than the 90 and 91 mugs, but focused more on graphic
        design. Graphics of hockey sticks and pucks were included on the sides along with the Bluenote and
        Maxwell House Coffee Cup logo. A very colorful and clean mug.
