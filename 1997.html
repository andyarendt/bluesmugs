<h1>1997 - 10th Annual Maxwell House Blues Mug Night</h1>
<body>
    <p>
        1997 began a long line of mugs that were navy colored. '97 was unique in that there was a second color style 
        given away. The reason for this is still unknown to me. There was a white version of this mug set on a blue background
        along with a 'Blues Coffee Mug Night' pin given out this year. Perhaps this is the reason for the chunky text and design
        of the mug itself. Maxwell House came out with a new logo, which is reflected on this mug along with the match up date,
        the opponent, and 30th Anniversary banner. The game was played in February.
