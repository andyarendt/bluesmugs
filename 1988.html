<h1>1988 - 1st Annual Maxwell House Blues Mug Night</h1>

<body>
    <p>
        The 1987-1988 Blues season was the first season that the organization gave
        away coffee mugs to fans that attended the game. The mug itself does not 
        display any information that indicates whether or not the club would be 
        giving away mugs to fans on an annual basis. The mug is a simple wide style
        coffee mug with St. Louis Blues printed next to an 80s era Bluenote logo on one side,
        and a small red Maxwell house logo and the words <i>Sponsor 1988 U.S. Olympic Team</i> on the other. 
        The latter is an indication of the year the mug was given to fans. It's unclear when or how fans obtained
        the mug. It could have been given out during the first couple weeks of March, as mug giveaway nights were 
        scheduled during this time frame in the years that came after. The 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary did
        however take place in the early weeks of February of 1988 - which could be an indicator that the mug 
        was released to fans a bit earlier.
