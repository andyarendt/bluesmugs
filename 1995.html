        The '95 Mug was again, extremely similar in appearance to the '93 and '94' mugs. However this mug does have a slightly taller, and thinner build. This mug was also the first and only one to feature the popular 90s Blues vintage look - blue, yellow, and red with the trumpet. It also memorializes the Blues first season in their new at the time arena - the Kiel Center. This game was played a month later than Coffee Mug Night games in the past were played.
