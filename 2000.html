        This millenium mug broke the navy trend with its white background. It was in the style of the season with it's pixelated hockey player image. The season years were highlighted along with the traditional Maxwell House logo and 13th Annual Mug Night designation. I was able to figure out the game date by looking at old pocket schedules on eBay.
